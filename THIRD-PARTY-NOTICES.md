## Starter templates

The bundled Universal Label Template examples under packages/ult/examples are released under CC0 1.0 by the ULT contributors. See the [CC0 1.0 legal code](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.en).

## OpenTLP hardware catalogue

`packages/hardware` contains OpenTLP's device and protocol-family data. The
source Markdown and generated catalogue data are CC0 1.0; validation and export
code are MIT. OpenTLP Studio generates its compact runtime projection from this
package during the build, so there is no separately maintained snapshot.

## Application runtimes

The optional desktop and headless applications use Electron, MQTT.js, esbuild, and
`@napi-rs/canvas`. These packages are distributed under the MIT License. Exact
versions and integrity hashes are recorded in `package-lock.json`; their source
distributions retain the corresponding copyright and licence notices.

## Other npm dependencies

Other production dependencies are installed from npm and retain their copyright and licence files. Exact versions and integrity hashes are recorded in package-lock.json. The audited release dependency set declares MIT, ISC, Apache-2.0, BSD-family, 0BSD, public-domain terms, or the pako compound licence above.

Redistributors who create a binary or packaged application should ship this file, the project LICENSE, the referenced font licence texts, and dependency licences required by their distribution format.
