MXW01 is the best-documented member of the V5X family. It is not a Tiny
`51 78` printer: image data uses a dedicated AE03 characteristic and control
packets begin `22 21`.

## Rebrand handling

Other V5X names are recorded on the family page. They are not aliases here
because shared protocol support alone does not prove that their non-protocol
hardware facts match MXW01.

## Not yet recorded

Manufacturer, certification, battery, enclosure, indicators and cutter geometry.
