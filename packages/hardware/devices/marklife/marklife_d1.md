    title: Marklife app device artwork
    note: >-
      The manufacturer's own application ships artwork for this model, which is
      what attributes it to Marklife rather than to the protocol family it
      shares with other badges.
  - kind: catalogue
    note: >-
      Transcribed from a driver's model table; specifications not confirmed
      against hardware.

Catalogued from the Marklife application, which ships artwork for this model.

## Printable width

Not recorded. The driver that lists this model places it in a group named
"OEM / Unknown", where the width is a fallback applied to unrecognised hardware
rather than a measured value.
A driver that supports this family lists it as `LuckP_D1`, suggesting the same
hardware is also sold under the LuckP badge. The Marklife app names it `D1`.

## Not yet recorded

Mechanism, media handling, power, indicators, and what the printer reports back.
