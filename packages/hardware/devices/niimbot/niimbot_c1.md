Catalogued from [niimbluelib](https://github.com/MultiMote/niimbluelib), the
reference implementation for this family. The printhead width, resolution,
accepted media and density range are what that library records; the mechanism,
power and physical details are unrecorded.

The [NIIMBOT Community Wiki](https://printers.niim.blue/) documents this family
in more depth than this page does.
