    note: Independent TypeScript subset for bitmap printing, with protocol-level tests.

Commands are ASCII and normally end in CRLF. `BITMAP` is the exception: its
comma-terminated ASCII header is followed immediately by `width × height`
binary bytes, then CRLF. `PRINT` commits the label buffer.

TSPL is vendor-neutral protocol documentation, so implementations should be
written from the programming specification rather than copied from a device
driver. Individual printers may implement only a subset or add extensions.
