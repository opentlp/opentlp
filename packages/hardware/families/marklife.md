## Status reporting

The printer reports battery level, charging state, loaded media and fault
conditions.

## Compression

Firmware expects `windowBits: 10`; the zlib default is 15. A stream compressed
with the default window is valid and decompresses correctly, and does not print.
The two-byte stream header distinguishes them: `28 91` is correct, `78 9c` is
not.

## Queries

Replies carry no tag identifying which request they answer. Issue one query,
wait for its reply, then issue the next.

## Not yet recorded

The command table beyond the query opcode. Packet length and checksum fields, if
any. Whether the raster header counts width in dots or bytes. Whether the family
spans more than one dialect across its 15 mm, 48 mm and 72 mm members.
