/**
 * The Marklife command set.
 *
 * These are *facts about the hardware*: the byte sequences a Marklife printer
 * responds to. They were established by observing the protocol, and they are
 * written here in this project's own terms — grouped by what you would want to
 * do, not by the shape of any other implementation.
 *
 * ## Two command dialects, and why both exist
 *
 * The family speaks two prefixes, and which one answers depends on the model:
 *
 *  - **`1F …` — the printer.** Anything about putting ink on paper: density,
 *    speed, media type, calibration, starting and stopping a job.
 *  - **`10 FF …` — the module.** Anything about the *device*: battery, serial
 *    number, firmware, MAC, auto-off. These are the queries shared across the
 *    P12/L13 generation, and their replies are untagged — the answer carries no
 *    echo of the question — so only one may be in flight at a time.
 *
 * There is also one lone ESC/POS survivor, `1B 4A n` (feed n dots), which these
 * printers honour because the firmware lineage passed through a receipt printer.
 *
 * ## Reading replies
 *
 * Every getter here is a *request*. The reply arrives on the notify
 * characteristic, unsolicited and unlabelled, so the driver is responsible for
 * knowing what it asked for. See {@link MarklifeDriver}.
